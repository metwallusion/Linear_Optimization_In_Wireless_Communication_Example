# Linear_Optimization_In_Wireless_Communication_Example
An example of solving one of the major wireless communication problem (interference) by using linear programming
Screenshot_1 and Screenshot_2 are showing the example
The m file is the solution for this problem
Note here : Function of linprog is not used since we are dealing with syms in matlab, this is why it is done manually.
>>> Input ? n which is the number of users you want to use to formulate a problem of optimization
>>> Output ? Sinr(Signal to interference ratio) , how can it be forumulated ? and of course C_transposed, A matrix and b that are the outcome of any optimization problem
Also check the solution in screenshot_3
